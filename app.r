    of each state had an effect on whether people would want to walk as a form of exercise, affecting their body weight. 
    This led us to take data from the following sources in order to compare them:
    Obesity: 2015 CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey (Lake County Illinois)
    Walkability: Information from each block group in the 2019 census (US Environmental Agency)
